The python code generates synthetic spectral data, applies smoothing techniques, and performs derivative calculations to analyze the data. It defines functions to create smoothed spectra using Gaussian distributions, compute first and second derivatives using finite difference methods, and detect peaks in the data based on derivative conditions. The RoughSpec function creates noisy spectral data by summing random Gaussian curves, while the SGF function applies a Savitzky-Golay filter for data smoothing. The code concludes by plotting the original noisy data alongside the smoothed data to visually compare the effects of the smoothing process. This approach is commonly used in signal processing and spectral analysis for noise reduction and feature detection.
